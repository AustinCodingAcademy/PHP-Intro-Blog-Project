1. What is the output of the following code?

       <?php

           $j = 5;
           $k = 3;
           
           echo 'a';
           
           if($j < 10) {
               echo 'b';
               $k += 1;
               if($k > 5) {
                   echo 'c';
               } else {
                   echo 'd';
               }
           }
           
           echo 'e';

       ?>
    
2. What is the output of the following code?

       <?php
           echo "I'm a string! ";
           echo 'I\'m another string! ';
           echo 'And I\\\'m another.';
       ?>

3. True or false:
    - The `%` operator gives the remainder of a division.
    - The values of variables are substituted into single-quoted strings.
    - In PHP, the type of every variable must be specified by the programmer.

4. Match each PHP operator to its meaning.

<table style="text-align: center; width: 50%">
    <tr>
        <th>Operators</th>
        <th>Meanings</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>Decrement</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>Concatenation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>++</td>
        <td>Addition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>--</td>
        <td>Increment</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>Subtraction</td>
    </tr>
</table>
