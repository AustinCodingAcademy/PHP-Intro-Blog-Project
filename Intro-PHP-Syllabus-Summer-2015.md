# How far we actually got last time (Approximate) #

* Day 1: Intro to Computers, Programming, and This Course
* Day 2: Values, Variables and Expressions
* Day 3: Numbers, Text and Strings, very basic HTML
* Day 4: Introduce Arrays and `foreach`
* Day 5: Conditionals and kept going on `foreach`.  Talked more about HTML and introduced CSS.
* Day 6: Conditionals and kept doing examples of `foreach`. Introduced `include`
* Day 7: More `foreach`, maybe did a `for` example too
* Day 8: Introduced functions, kept going on conditional examples and `foreach`
* Day 9: Kept talking about functions, did several examples.  Talked about difference between `function` and `include`: both examples of Code Reuse, but `function` is safer.
* Day 10: Introduced Blog Project (no demo, just started creating the HTML first)
* Day 11: Refined our HTML for the Blog Project, talked about how we could use arrays and `foreach` to make it dynamic
* Day 12: Create a nested array of Articles with "Title", "Date", "Author" and "Content" keys.  Used a `foreach` to show all the article content from the array instead of having it hard-coded into the HTML
* Day 13: Learned how to use `serialize` and `unserialize` along with `file_put_contents` and `file_get_contents` to store our Articles.  Created functions for saving and loading the whole array of articles into a file called `articles.file`
* Day 14: Continued to tweak our Article functionality, including a Form to create a New Article.  Intro to Forms, $_GET and $_POST.
* Day 15: Blog Project: new form for Edit Article functionality, continued explaining Forms, and integrating our Forms with our save/load functionality.
* Day 16: Blog Project: Edit Article functionality, created rudimentary Delete functionality
* Day 17: Intro to Javascript to make a Popup asking "Are you sure?" when you delete a Post
* Day 18: Continued explaining the Javascript, helped people finish their Edit and Delete functionality
* Day 19: Intro to Databases / MySQL, started applying DB to Blog Project
* Day 20: Continued Database stuff, tried to teach them as much as possible, didn't fully integrate Blog with DB
    * End of course: everyone had a working Blog Project which they showed me.  Everyone passed.
    * Some students continued to correspond with me to learn more about how to use the DB for their blog instead of serializing to a file
