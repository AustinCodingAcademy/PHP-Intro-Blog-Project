# Day 4 Homework

## Forms

1. Add a dropdown list to the form we made in class today. In your PHP code, get the value selected from the dropdown and display it on the screen.

2. Add some radio buttons to your form. This can be a yes/no choice or something more complicated. Again, access the selected value from PHP.

## Concepts

1. Write `function cube($num)` that accepts a number `num` and returns `num^3`.

2. Write `function power($num, $pow)` that accepts a number `num` and a power `pow` and returns `num^pow`.

3. Write `function printRandomGreeting($person)` that takes in the name of a person and greets that person. The greeting should be chosen randomly from an array of greetings.
