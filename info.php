// Intro to PHP: Day 4!
// We're a day ahead, so I'd like to take today to review some concepts
// that might have been tricky the first time around.

// Topics:
//     - Review if/else and talk about "else if(...)"
//     - Review for loop parts and what happens during each iteration
//     - && and ||
//     - Talk about foreach loop
//     - Review functions

// And here's the only new material for today:
//     - Talk about code reuse! `include`, `require_once`

// else if example problem:
// Create an array of seasons and pick one randomly.
// Then use an if... else if... else to check if it's summer, winter, or something else.
// Echo some output in each case.
